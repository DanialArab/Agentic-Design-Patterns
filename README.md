# Agentic-Design-Patterns

The design patterns:

- Reflection: The LLM examines its own work to come up with ways to improve it. 
- Tool Use: The LLM is given tools such as web search, code execution, or any other function to help it gather information, take action, or process data.
- Planning: The LLM comes up with, and executes, a multistep plan to achieve a goal (for example, writing an outline for an essay, then doing online research, then writing a draft, and so on).
- Multi-agent collaboration: More than one AI agent work together, splitting up tasks and discussing and debating ideas, to come up with better solutions than a single agent would.
